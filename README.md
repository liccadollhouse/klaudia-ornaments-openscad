# klaudia-ornaments-openscad
OpenSCAD for Klaudia's mantle ornaments.

Version history:

v.1.0 - Initial version.

The way I do my OpenSCAD code is the following:  I create a "master" file with all the modules of the individual parts of the staff.  Then, I create individual OpenSCAD files that includes the master file, and only calls the individual module that is to be printed.

Klaudia's mantle ornaments consist of three parts: the large bottom part, the small join in the center, and the top part.  The top part has a slot where you can put in a jump ring to attach the ornament to her mantle.  Print 4 copies of each part.  The holes in the bottom and top are purposely made bigger to give room to get the glue inside.

I am, of course, open to suggestions and improvements.  I will definitely be making improvements to this model as time permits.  You may contact me through GitHub.
